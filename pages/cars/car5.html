        This coveted Mercedes-Benz 300 SL Roadster was delivered to the USA in 1961, ex works in fire engine red (DB534)
        with black hardtop and black leather interior. As an absolute specialty, the car was equipped with disc brakes
        on both axles and is therefore limited to 269 only vehicles. According to the old German vehicle registration
        document, the car was imported from the USA in May 1986 and registered in Berlin. It remained there until 1989
        before being registered in England in 1992. The current owner acquired the car in the mid-1990s and it has been
        in collector's hands ever since. In recent months HK-ENGINEERING carried out extensive service work on engine,
        gearbox and brakes. Secure this 300 SL Roadster, limited to 269 units, with coveted disc brakes, hardtop and
        excellent driving values!
