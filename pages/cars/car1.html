        The Best of Show winner, a deep-blue 1937 Delahaye 135M Roadster Cabriolet, puttered up the horseshoe drive and
        past the judges’ stand to fanfare typical of a classic car expo.

        Such a meticulously restored, and rakish, car was to be expected at a vintage-vehicle show. The location,
        however, was anything but typical — the Concours d’Elegance was held for the first time at the Detroit Institute
        of Arts, a Beaux-Arts museum in the heart of America’s Motor City.

        “As remarkable as it may seem, there has not been a car show of this caliber in the city of Detroit, ever,” said
        Richard Vaughan, a veteran car designer who sits on the advisory team for the event, which took place on Sept.
        18. “We really felt strongly that an event celebrating the automobile should be in the city of Detroit, the city
        that put the world on wheels.”
        
        Events like the Concours d’Elegance, which tend to showcase classic cars built during the first half of the 20th century, usually take place at upscale resorts such as Pebble Beach on the Monterey Peninsula of California or Villa d’Este on the shore of Lake Como in Italy. By holding the event in Detroit‌, organizers sought to celebrate the city’s automotive history.
