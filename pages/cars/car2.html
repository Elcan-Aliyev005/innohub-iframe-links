        The Delahaye USA Pacific is a modern-day homage to Jean Bugatti’s masterpiece, the Type 57S Atlantic. Delahaye
        USA is the noted firm based in New Jersey founded by Terry Cook, the former editor of Car Craft and Hot Rod
        magazines. The Pacific was hand built over a four-year period and features breathtaking fiberglass coachwork
        with sensual Art Deco curves reminiscent of the original Atlantic. The car is built on a custom steel-tube
        chassis ten inches longer than the original Type 57S and is powered by a modern 300-hp BMW M70B50 SOHC
        12-cylinder fuel-injected engine paired to a BMW 4HP24 four-speed automatic transmission. Power is sent to a
        Ford 9-inch rear end and moved along on Dayton wire wheels with new Dunlop tires.

        The interior exhibits wonderful engine-turned design on the console and dash, the latter of which is equipped
        with new vintage-look instrumentation. The classic-inspired seats feature stainless steel framework and are
        trimmed in brocaded fabric with contrasting welting. The door cards are wrapped in leather, completing the
        vintage look of the luxurious cockpit. The car is equipped with air conditioning, heat, and power windows for
        modern convenience and comfort.

        With just four examples of the legendary Type 57S Atlantic originally built by Bugatti, they fall in the realm
        of unobtanium. The Pacific offers a wonderful alternative with its breathtaking curves and reliable modern
        underpinnings and creature comforts, such as the automatic transmission and air conditioning. The Delahaye USA
        Pacific is sure to turn heads no matter where it may travel, be it on any side of either ocean.
